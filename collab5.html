							<p>The format of this section of the e-Portfolio for Research Methods and Professional Practice is split into sections covering each unit.</p>
							<p>Each unit is split into a general reflection followed by any tasks undertaken during the unit. This means that any collaborative discussion initial and summary posts will appear in the unit they were intended to be completed. For example, the initial post for the first collaborative discussion will appear under Unit 1 and the summary post in Unit 3. References will be provided where applicable in each section.</p>						
							<p>Additionally, it should be noted reflections are my general thoughts, feelings, and learnings on the topic of the unit and thus will rarely include any references.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>In this introductory unit, there were a few activities to undertake. Unfortunately, due to time constraints in my personal life, I was unable to contribute to discussions at the time but have written what my contribution would have been below. </p>
							<p>This was a broad introduction that focused mostly on ethics and standards in computing as well as scientific methods for reasoning.</p>
							<p>I believe that this unit set a good precedent for what to expect from the module, and I gained a better understanding of the ethics surrounding the area of computing.</p>
							
							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion I – Initial Post</h2>
							<p>The aim of this post will be to evaluate the practices of Corazón in comparison to the British Computer Society Code of Conduct (BCS Code of conduct, 2022) regarding the (harmless) security vulnerability discovered by a researcher in their medical device (Case: Medical implant risk analysis - ACM ethics 2021).</p>
							<p>There are 4 parts to the code of conduct, and each will be considered in turn, with reference to specific codes.</p>
							<p>Public Interest:</p>
							<p>By the very nature of the implant device, Corazón complies with this part of the code as it demonstrates due regard for public health and wellbeing (1.a). Additionally, by having an accessible device that has an easy-to-use app, Corazon also promotes equal access to the benefits of IT (1.d). </p>
							<p>Professional Competence and Integrity:</p>
							<p>Instead of using proprietary techniques, using standard cryptographic algorithms demonstrates compliance with 2.a, only undertaking work within professional competence.</p>
							<p>Duty to Relevant Authority:</p>
							<p>By actively pursuing regulatory compliance to regulatory standards, Corazón demonstrates its due diligence to fulfilling obligations to the relevant regulations.</p>
							<p>Duty to the Profession:</p>
							<p>With on-going commitments to consult with researchers and openness of product performance and security by welcoming scrutiny, Corazón proves that it complies with all aspects of this code.</p>
							<p>On this basis, Corazon shows exemplary practices regarding ethics. However, in lieu of examining this case in isolation, there is a call for greater regulatory frameworks as not all risks are accounted for in current standards for smart implant devices (Harmon et al., 2015) thus it remains to be seen whether this case would uphold the ethics if new regulations were put in place.</p>

							<h2>Task – Reasoning Quiz</h2>
							<p>This quiz sought to test knowledge of differentiating between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is making an inference based on accepted facts or premise and for it to work, the premise must be true (Inductive vs. deductive vs. Abductive Reasoning). E.g. All humans have hearts. Rhiannon is a human. Thus, she must have a heart. On the other hand, for inductive reasoning, the premise is likely but not necessarily true based on observations (Hawthorne, 2018).</p>

							<h2>Task – Ethics in Computing</h2>
							<p>This is a short review of the potential ethical issues that may be associated with the role of a software engineer within a recruitment company such as Adecco. This is not an exhaustive list of ethical and legal issues surrounding the role and I will examine such issues briefly.</p>
							<p>One of the largest potential concerns is the collection of PII from candidates. This data would be needed for contacting clients via telephone and email, and as such, would need to be stored securely and wherever possible, be anonymised and keyed if data is to be used outside of normal communications for a legitimate purpose. Thus, it is important to be aware of regulations such as GDPR that govern how such data should be processed and maintained (Regulation - 2016/679 - en - GDPR - EUR-lex 2016).</p>
							<p>Furthermore, should a candidate wish to delete their data, the software engineer should be aware of the process to remove all PII where applicable.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 2 - Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>Although I did not submit this for review, I completed a literature review outline which helped me in constructing the final version.</p>
							<p>This unit focused on research questions and the tasks and assignments required for the completion of this module. This was very helpful in giving me ideas for the literature review and how to structure it as this was the first time I would write a literature review.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I started brewing ideas on my research proposal with consideration given to my final research module.</p>
							
							<h2>Task - Literature review Outline</h2>
							<p>I chose to conduct my literature review on the topic of the use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis.</p>
							<p>The intention of this literature review is to establish the applications of artificial intelligence in undertaking a medical diagnosis. Historically, AI has been used as early as the 1970s for medical purposes. Due to the exponential growth of AI in recent years and the sensitive morality of medical diagnosis it would be prudent to explore the history of AI in healthcare settings to better understand the applications, ethics, and bias in this context.</p>
							<p>Through an initial evaluation of the topic, three common themes emerge around the topic of artificial intelligence applications in medical diagnostics. The history and development of AI in medical diagnostics, the applications and efficacy of AI in medical diagnostics, and the potential bias in AI and medical diagnostics. This literature review intends to establish and cross reference several sources under each topic, with the aim to provide an overview of the prevailing themes within each of the three aforementioned topics.</p>
							<p>Within history and development of AI in medical diagnostics, this literature review will evaluate studies from the infancy of computer technology to trace the lineage of the modern-day AI applications. This segues into discussing the second topic of applications and efficacy in AI. Through this second section, the literature review intends to analyse the different methodologies of AI, for example, the use of deep learning to detect COVID-19 during the most recent pandemic. Through the study of multiple applications, the literature review will finally discuss the risk of bias in AI medical diagnostics. Through assessing multiple applications in the previous section, the literature review will then assess the many ways in which bias can factor into AI models.</p>
							<p>Finally, the literature review will discuss the limitations, strengths, and discrepancies. These are expected to include the limited scope of the review, the breadth of the study in encompassing multiple areas of a broad topic, and the limitation of effective documentation of bias in academic literature.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 3 - Research Methods</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This module introduced me to the various research methods and tools available to use for research design. This gave me much to consider in terms of my final output for the research proposal, as my initial (and final) idea didn’t necessarily need much in the way of first hand (primary) data collection or research.</p>
							
							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion I Summary Post</h2>
							<p>The initial posts discussed by everyone cover a broad range of case studies and each demonstrate an understanding of ethical breaches as well as ethical compliance relating to BCS Code of Conduct (BCS Code of conduct, 2022) as well as legislation in some cases such as the UK Equality Act 2010 (Equality act 2010). </p>
							<p>In the case study I looked at, it was clear that whilst there were concerns over security of a medical implant device, the company was following due process in accordance with ethical standards and guidelines (Case: Medical implant risk analysis - ACM ethics 2021)</p>
							<p>In other cases, there is demonstrably discrimination in workplaces, especially regarding the gender gap in the computing industry (Kröhn et al, 2020). Additionally, there is evidence of breaches of confidentiality agreements that call into question ethics vs legality as discussed in other posts (Brey, 2017). </p>
							<p>In conclusion, there are many ethical, social, and legal considerations in the world of computing. Guidelines and regulations should be observed and not be overlooked in all aspects.</p>

							<h2>Task - Research Proposal Review</h2>
							<p><b></b>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</b></p>
							<p>Given my aim of understanding current regulatory standards and ethical issues ongoing in various aspects of AI, in would be conducive to use both initial exploratory research to investigate the current effectiveness of regulations followed by conclusive research to critically analyse regulatory standards and address the issues with suggestions on new regulations.</p>
							<p><b></b>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</b></p>
							<p>Ultimately, the research proposal will need only require secondary research with a mixture of both qualitative and quantitative research methods (Secondary research: Definition, methods, & examples 2022; Qualitative vs. quantitative research: What's the difference? 2023). I.e., I will be examining extant literature on case studies and observations that explain occurrences of ethical issues as well as exploring the extent to which they have effect.</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit was a continuation of the previous modules research methods, with particular attention given to focus groups, case studies, and observations (quantitative and qualitative). It helped further my knowledge on data collection methods and how they are carried out, when they are suitable, and ultimately helped me understand the data types obtained from these methods.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit taught me how to design and conduct interviews and surveys and their usefulness in both pre-testing and post-testing. Post-testing surveys could be useful, for my research proposal on regulations to garner how successful the usage of my proposed regulations is but is likely outside the scope due to time constraints.</p>
							<p>The activity gave me insight into how data collected in surveys can be used for other, less ethical purposes, especially when purported to be collected for ‘research’ purposes.</p>
							<h2>Task – Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
							<p>In 2018, there was a scandal relating to the sharing of data obtained from Facebook users obtained via surveys. Cambridge Analytica, the company responsible for the scandal, sold data that was used to create psychological profiles of voters for political campaigns (Confessore, 2018).</p>
							<p>The data was obtained by an app that paid users to take a personality quiz. To complete the quiz, users were required to consent to give access to their Facebook profiles and their friends profiles (Cambridge Analytica, 2018).</p>
							<p>The owner of the app then agreed to give the data to Cambridge Analytica which then used it to combine with other sources to create personality profiles. The aim was to use this data to identify personalities of voters and influence their behaviour (Prokop, 2018).</p>
							<p>This is not the only time that personality quizzes have been used. Presenting as innocuous, data from quizzes produced by CubeYou have been used to help marketers find customers – a very similar case to the one discussed above, except that instead of trying to influence behaviour of voters, it’s customers (Mishcastillo, 2018).</p>
							<p>In both cases, there is a clear misuse of data gained from surveys and is unquestionably unethical. Users are partaking in surveys for monetary gain and/or enjoyment to find out what personality type they have. Whilst there was consent given for profile details, there is little regulation on what can happen to the data gathered regarding its sale and further use.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This helped me to distinguish between questionnaires and surveys, with questionnaires being part of conducting a survey and are a set of questions with choice of answer.</p>
							<p>Additionally, knowing how to create a good questionnaire is an essential tool for a researcher to know to maximise the quality of data collected.</p>
							<h2>Task – Data Collection</h2>
							<p>As the nature of the topic of my research proposal (discussed in earlier and later units) leans on secondary research, the research tools used are found in the surrounding literature and legislation and it is unlikely that I would need to utilise any tools for data collection first hand.</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit was the submission of the literature review and submission for the 2nd collaborative discussion initial post.</p>
							<p>This continued the discussion on ethics in data and research which tied into the topic of my literature review which was the use of AI in medical diagnosis. As discussed in the review, there are many issues in ethics in this area and ties in with my research proposal (though, this was not used in the planning of my research proposal).</p>
							
							<h2>Task - Collaborative Discussion II Initial Post</h2>
							<p>There are ethical concerns over the courses of action that Abi can take regarding the presentation of the data.</p>
							<p>First and foremost, it is important to note that Abi is not obligated to do anything in a particular way and can present the facts in whatever manner he chooses. However, the best practice would be to present all the facts, regardless of which conclusion it supports and should provide a holistic view of the data to the manufacturer. It is important to recognise the ability of a data professional to misuse statistical tools (Thiese et al., 2015) and therefore it is crucial that Abi ensures that he does not invalidate results in this way.</p>
							<p>Beyond this, Abi has no responsibility for how the data is then used. But, in the case of food manufacturing, there are rules around nutritional values and food standards such as Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 (Lex - 02011R1169-20180101 - en - EUR-Lex 2011), so the consequences of the outcome of the project are limited in scope. </p>

							<h2>Task - Research Proposal Outline</h2>
							<p>The Ethics of AI is a particularly pertinent topic due to the upcoming publication of the Artificial Intelligence Act by the European Union. AI has grown exponentially faster than modern democracies can feasibly legislate for and the negative potential outcomes of AI operates under significant risk if not adequately regulated against. </p>
							<p>The topic of this research proposal, Ethics in Artificial Intelligence aims to explore four key themes about the topic of regulation and legislative practices of AI. This includes bias in the training and development of AI models, use of intellectual property without permissions or licensing, usage and purpose of AI, and an analysis of the current and future guidelines and regulation. A key issue demonstrated effectively in the context of medical diagnostics is the inherent risk of bias in AI ethics. Additionally, the use of intellectual property to train AI models, such as image and language generative tools, is a significant concern within AI discourse. The aim of the research topic will be to assess the capacity of regulation to alleviate these ethical concerns. The intended output of the research would be to create a framework for ethical regulation.</p>
							<p>To achieve this, the primary methodology will involve comprehensive literature reviews to analyse existing legislation, discuss the benefits and risks of regulation on innovation and growth, as well as a review of existing guidelines and regulations for each topic. The proposal will outline several sources covering these different topics seeking to cross reference multiple sources under each topic</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This extended the data analysis portion from the last unit, and I learnt some new tools in excel in the process as I am more used to using R and Python for my statistical needs. However, it is good to be able to utilise the tools available to you, and I enjoyed creating the various charts to describe the data in the worksheets.</p>
							<h2>Task - Collaborative Discussion II Summary Post</h2>
							<p>The issues that Abi faces underpin the necessity to undertake all necessary precautions and follow relevant guidelines, regulations, and best practices. This is especially true when delivering projects that may impact public health (Chen et al., 2014). It has been well established that using inappropriate statistical methods will invalidate research outcomes (Thiese et al., 2015).</p>
							<p>Thus, the evidence is clear that Abi should take care in how he represents his data but should aim to provide all the facts. In any case, because of the nature of the product he is analysing being a food product, there are limitations to what the data can then be used for as manufacturers must accurately represent the nutritional value of their products (Lex - 02011R1169-20180101 - en - EUR-Lex 2011). </p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit helped consolidate the knowledge I had gained throughout the module and how to present them in an ePortfolio. I had already developed an ePortfolio and this just solidified the ideas that are already present in my ePortfolio.</p>
							<p>I would say that I personally don’t find it very useful, and I will not be using thia iteration of it again outside of this course or sharing it with anyone, despite the purported benefits.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>The final unit taught me the concept of project management and how project management works culminating in a self-test quiz that I managed to get 100% on. The concept of project management was not unfamiliar to me; in my job I work with project managers daily. It was helpful to learn a deeper understanding of the processes they may undertake and will be useful moving forward should I undertake further projects.</p>
