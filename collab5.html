							<p>The format of this section of the e-Portfolio for Research Methods and Professional Practice is split into sections covering each unit.</p>
							<p>Each unit is split into a general reflection followed by any tasks undertaken during the unit. This means that any collaborative discussion initial and summary posts will appear in the unit they were intended to be completed. For example, the initial post for the first collaborative discussion will appear under Unit 1 and the summary post in Unit 3. References will be provided where applicable in each section.</p>						
							<p>Additionally, it should be noted reflections are my general thoughts, feelings, and learnings on the topic of the unit and thus will rarely include any references.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>In this introductory unit, there were a few activities to undertake. Unfortunately, due to time constraints in my personal life, I was unable to contribute to discussions at the time but have written what my contribution would have been below. </p>
							<p>This was a broad introduction that focused mostly on ethics and standards in computing as well as scientific methods for reasoning.</p>
							<p>I believe that this unit set a good precedent for what to expect from the module, and I gained a better understanding of the ethics surrounding the area of computing.</p>
							
							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion I – Initial Post</h2>
							<p>The aim of this post will be to evaluate the practices of Corazón in comparison to the British Computer Society Code of Conduct (BCS Code of conduct, 2022) regarding the (harmless) security vulnerability discovered by a researcher in their medical device (Case: Medical implant risk analysis - ACM ethics 2021).</p>
							<p>There are 4 parts to the code of conduct, and each will be considered in turn, with reference to specific codes.</p>
							<p>Public Interest:</p>
							<p>By the very nature of the implant device, Corazón complies with this part of the code as it demonstrates due regard for public health and wellbeing (1.a). Additionally, by having an accessible device that has an easy-to-use app, Corazon also promotes equal access to the benefits of IT (1.d). </p>
							<p>Professional Competence and Integrity:</p>
							<p>Instead of using proprietary techniques, using standard cryptographic algorithms demonstrates compliance with 2.a, only undertaking work within professional competence.</p>
							<p>Duty to Relevant Authority:</p>
							<p>By actively pursuing regulatory compliance to regulatory standards, Corazón demonstrates its due diligence to fulfilling obligations to the relevant regulations.</p>
							<p>Duty to the Profession:</p>
							<p>With on-going commitments to consult with researchers and openness of product performance and security by welcoming scrutiny, Corazón proves that it complies with all aspects of this code.</p>
							<p>On this basis, Corazon shows exemplary practices regarding ethics. However, in lieu of examining this case in isolation, there is a call for greater regulatory frameworks as not all risks are accounted for in current standards for smart implant devices (Harmon et al., 2015) thus it remains to be seen whether this case would uphold the ethics if new regulations were put in place.</p>

							<h2>Task – Reasoning Quiz</h2>
							<p>This quiz sought to test knowledge of differentiating between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is making an inference based on accepted facts or premise and for it to work, the premise must be true (Inductive vs. deductive vs. Abductive Reasoning). E.g. All humans have hearts. Rhiannon is a human. Thus, she must have a heart. On the other hand, for inductive reasoning, the premise is likely but not necessarily true based on observations (Hawthorne, 2018).</p>

							<h2>Task – Ethics in Computing</h2>
							<p>This is a short review of the potential ethical issues that may be associated with the role of a software engineer within a recruitment company such as Adecco. This is not an exhaustive list of ethical and legal issues surrounding the role and I will examine such issues briefly.</p>
							<p>One of the largest potential concerns is the collection of PII from candidates. This data would be needed for contacting clients via telephone and email, and as such, would need to be stored securely and wherever possible, be anonymised and keyed if data is to be used outside of normal communications for a legitimate purpose. Thus, it is important to be aware of regulations such as GDPR that govern how such data should be processed and maintained (Regulation - 2016/679 - en - GDPR - EUR-lex 2016).</p>
							<p>Furthermore, should a candidate wish to delete their data, the software engineer should be aware of the process to remove all PII where applicable.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 2 - Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>Although I did not submit this for review, I completed a literature review outline which helped me in constructing the final version.</p>
							<p>This unit focused on research questions and the tasks and assignments required for the completion of this module. This was very helpful in giving me ideas for the literature review and how to structure it as this was the first time I would write a literature review.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I started brewing ideas on my research proposal with consideration given to my final research module.</p>
							
							<h2>Task - Literature review Outline</h2>
							<p>I chose to conduct my literature review on the topic of the use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis.</p>
							<p>The intention of this literature review is to establish the applications of artificial intelligence in undertaking a medical diagnosis. Historically, AI has been used as early as the 1970s for medical purposes. Due to the exponential growth of AI in recent years and the sensitive morality of medical diagnosis it would be prudent to explore the history of AI in healthcare settings to better understand the applications, ethics, and bias in this context.</p>
							<p>Through an initial evaluation of the topic, three common themes emerge around the topic of artificial intelligence applications in medical diagnostics. The history and development of AI in medical diagnostics, the applications and efficacy of AI in medical diagnostics, and the potential bias in AI and medical diagnostics. This literature review intends to establish and cross reference several sources under each topic, with the aim to provide an overview of the prevailing themes within each of the three aforementioned topics.</p>
							<p>Within history and development of AI in medical diagnostics, this literature review will evaluate studies from the infancy of computer technology to trace the lineage of the modern-day AI applications. This segues into discussing the second topic of applications and efficacy in AI. Through this second section, the literature review intends to analyse the different methodologies of AI, for example, the use of deep learning to detect COVID-19 during the most recent pandemic. Through the study of multiple applications, the literature review will finally discuss the risk of bias in AI medical diagnostics. Through assessing multiple applications in the previous section, the literature review will then assess the many ways in which bias can factor into AI models.</p>
							<p>Finally, the literature review will discuss the limitations, strengths, and discrepancies. These are expected to include the limited scope of the review, the breadth of the study in encompassing multiple areas of a broad topic, and the limitation of effective documentation of bias in academic literature.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 3 - Research Methods</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This module introduced me to the various research methods and tools available to use for research design. This gave me much to consider in terms of my final output for the research proposal, as my initial (and final) idea didn’t necessarily need much in the way of first hand (primary) data collection or research.</p>
							
							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion Summary Post</h2>
							<p>The initial posts discussed by everyone cover a broad range of case studies and each demonstrate an understanding of ethical breaches as well as ethical compliance relating to BCS Code of Conduct (BCS Code of conduct, 2022) as well as legislation in some cases such as the UK Equality Act 2010 (Equality act 2010). </p>
							<p>In the case study I looked at, it was clear that whilst there were concerns over security of a medical implant device, the company was following due process in accordance with ethical standards and guidelines (Case: Medical implant risk analysis - ACM ethics 2021)</p>
							<p>In other cases, there is demonstrably discrimination in workplaces, especially regarding the gender gap in the computing industry (Kröhn et al, 2020). Additionally, there is evidence of breaches of confidentiality agreements that call into question ethics vs legality as discussed in other posts (Brey, 2017). </p>
							<p>In conclusion, there are many ethical, social, and legal considerations in the world of computing. Guidelines and regulations should be observed and not be overlooked in all aspects.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 4 - Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit helped me build upon my knowledge of linear regression from the previous units and introduced me to the Scikit-Learn library in python. This enabled me to easily create my own linear regression models. </p>
							<p>However, in this unit, I struggled with this task and sought the help from classmates and conducted research to help find answers. In the end, I managed to come up with a working model for correlation and regression for the GDP and Population datasets. I utilised my skills gained from the EDA unit to help with the initial data preprocessing but needed help on combining the data as this was not something I had previous experience in.</p>
							<h2>Task – Correlation and Regression</h2>
							<p>Please see the Jupyter Notebook for the task here: <li style="margin-left: 40px"><a href="https://github.com/rhowjo/rhowjo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Unit%204%20-%20Task.ipynb">GDP and Population Jupyter Notebook</a></li></p>
							<p>In this task, we were given two datasets. The first dataset contained data for the GDP of each country and the second dataset contained data for the population of each country. We were tasked to combine the datasets to create a correlation graph that showed the relationship between the mean population and mean GDP of all the countries from 2001 to 2020.</p>
							<p>The data firstly had to be pre-processed so that the there were no null values by replacing them with the median of any given column. Then, the data was limited to 2001 onwards and converted to numeric. After this, the mean for both datasets were calculated and put into a single data frame.</p>
							<p>When showing this in a scatter plot, we can see that correlation is sparse. A Pearsons correlation coefficient of 0.031 confirms this. There are a quite a few outliers which can also affect the coefficient score.</p>
							<p>This data was then put into a linear regression model. Firstly, the data was reshaped into one column and then split into train and test datasets with a test size of 25%.</p>
							<p>After training, we can see that the R2 score is 0.0019, generally meaning that 0.19% of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable. That is to say that this is not a good model for predicting GDP from population or population from GDP. </p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 5 - Clustering</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This unit focused on clustering. Clustering is a method of partitioning data into groups (clusters). These are defined as data points that have more similarity that other data points. It’s predominately used for customer segmentation in businesses (Kaushik, 2023).</p>
							<p>This was my first experience with clustering but it’s applications and uses made sense to me from a business perspective, especially when envisioning customer segmentation. With this knowledge, I was more comfortable going into future units because I had a good base understanding in terms of how the measurements of distance worked as well as how to evaluate whether clustering has worked well or not (Manimaran, 2021).</p>

							<h2>Task – Jaccard Coefficient</h2>
							<p>For this task, we were asked to look at Jaccard Coefficient Calculations also known as Jaccard similarity. This is used to compute the similarity between objects.</p>
							<p>The formula is thus: JC=Ni/(Na+Nb−Ni)</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Ni is the intersecting elements (how many elements are shared between the sets</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Na is the number of elements in set A.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Nb is the number of elements in set B.</p>
							<p>In this scenario, elements will be instances of Y and P in the various columns.</p>
							<p>Jack and Mary:</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Jack – Fever, Test-1 = 2 elements</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Mary – Fever, Test-1, Test-3 = 3 elements</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Intersecting Elements = 2</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; JC = 2/ (2+3−2) = 0.66</p>
							<p>Jack and Jim:</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; Jack – Fever, Test-1 = 2 elements</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This reflection will focus on the group project as in this Unit, the first group project was due. This was a difficult process as the team was not working well. Each person did their own EDA and subsequently created their own models. However, too much focus was put on k-means clustering which didn’t produce successful results on this dataset. It was my idea to use regression models to predict price. </p>
							<p>We didn’t settle on a clear question until after the EDA. After this analysis, we produced the question: “what features have the biggest impact on price?”</p>
							<p>In my version, which produced the final model, the model was based of regression methods and iterated through different models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost.</p>
							<p>It was in this process that I learnt about hyperparameter tuning in order to prevent overfitting, as well as increasing accuracy (Olaoye, 2022). In the end, I produced a model that reached 64% accuracy, which, with more relevant variables included in the data, could be even higher (T, 2019).</p>
							<p>This was a difficult task to complete because I had essentially done all the code and the final report on my own with little outside help from my teammates.</p>
							<p>It was beneficial that I am self-proficient and had a good understanding of what needed to be done to complete this task. Although, I do believe that with better collaboration between the group, we would have gotten a better grade.</p>

							<h2>Task – K-means Clustering</h2>
							<h3>Task A: Iris</h3>
							<p>Link to Jupyter Notebook for Task A: <li  style="margin-left: 40px"><a href="https://github.com/rhowjo/rhowjo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Task%20A%20-%20Iris.ipynb">Task A Jupyter Notebook</a></li></p>
							<p>Firstly, k-mean clustering was performed on the iris dataset.</p>
							<p>To begin, the distributions between each variable was looked at. We can already see that the different species are already grouped in some ways when it comes to relationships between variables.</p>
							<p>Next, k-means cluster was performed for 1-10 clusters. Using the elbow curve, we can see the optimal number of clusters is 3 – which matches the number of species in the dataset.</p>
							<p>We can see that the clusters are mostly distinct but with some overlap.</p>
							<h3>Task B: Wine</h3>
							<p>Link to Jupyter Notebook for Task B: <li style="margin-left: 40px"><a href="https://github.com/rhowjo/rhowjo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Task%20B%20-%20Wine.ipynb">Task B Jupyter Notebook</a></li></p>
							<p>The second task was to look at the wine data set. Similar to the Iris dataset, there are 3 unique values for wine. The process for k-means clustering was comparable to the Iris dataset. When looking at the elbow curve, again, the optimal number of clusters is 3.</p>
							<p>However, for this dataset I used PCA (principal component analysis) to help plot the data. This reduces the dimensionality of the data set. The idea is to reduce the number of variables whilst preserving as much information as possible (Jaadi, 2023).</p>
							<p>In the plot we can see three distinct clusters for wine and their respective centroids. Following this is a heat map of the variables.</p>
							<h3>Task C: Weather</h3>
							<p>Link to Jupyter Notebook for Task C: <li style="margin-left: 40px"><a href="https://github.com/rhowjo/rhowjo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Task%20C%20-%20Weather.ipynb">Task C Jupyter Notebook</a></li></p>
							<p>For the final task, I used the same methods as in the other two datasets and plotted an elbow curve, which again has optimal number of clusters of 3. However, after looping through we can see the centroid are very close together for each group and there is an increasing overlap/overfit as the clusters increase.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This was my first experience of neural networks. This introduction to ANN helped immensely when creating an initial model for the unit 11 project to create a neural network using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It provided me a fundamental understanding and baseline to work from.</p>
							<p>The fact that artificial neural networks are based on the human brain in terms of structure is incredibly interesting to me and helped me develop a better understanding by examining this analogy (Walczak & Cerpa, 2003).</p>

							</p>
							<h2>Task - Perceptron Activities</h2>
							<p>In this task I gained a deeper understanding of Perceptron. This is a neural network link containing computations that track features and uses AI in the input data. In other words, it’s an ANN.</p>
							<p>It is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. It enables neurons to learn process elements in the training set one at a time (Banoula, 2023).</p>
							<p>Below are observations based on the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the seminar materials:</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; In exercise 1, by changing the inputs and weights, I observed different results. For example, having positive weight i.e., 04, 02 resulted in the sum function being greater than or equal to 1. This means that the neuron in this case is activated.</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; In exercise 2, the step activation function is used again. This time the small dataset it then trained to then be able to classify new instances of data. This helped me understand the basics of how an ANN works and how it can be used to classify new data after training the model on a very small dataset</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px">&bull; In exercise 3, the sigmoid function is used to create a multi-layer Perceptron. This time, epochs are introduced. The number of epochs defines the number of times the algorithm will work through the training dataset. In this exercise, 100 epochs are used and then up to 1,000,000. This shows a complete neural network and demonstrates how it performs.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>In this unit, there were 3 total tasks. Completing all of them was a challenge but I managed to balance my workload which in turn meant that I was able to produce the work required.</p>
							<p>It was tough because there was a wide range of topic from the training of neural networks in terms of how mistakes are rectified via feedback loops or backpropagation algorithm (Loft, 2023) to the legal and ethical implications of ANN applications.</p>
							<p>I gained a lot of knowledge in terms of legality and ethical views on neural networks and AI as well as gaining further knowledge on implementation of an ANN.</p>

							<h2>Task - Gradeient Cost Function</h2>
							<p>In this task, we were asked to observe changes in cost in the Jupyter Notebook provided in the seminar materials.</p>
							<p>Below I have collated information on how the gradient cost function works and the impact of the learning rate and iterations:</p>
							<p>A cost function is the measure of error in a prediction by an algorithm by indicating the difference between predicted values and actual values for a dataset (Banoula, 2023). A technique used to minimise the cost function is this gradient descent method (Team, 2022). The smaller the cost function, the more accurate the results of the predictive model.</p>
							<p>The learning rate in gradient descent, and in this demonstration of gradient cost function, controls the rate at which the model adapts to the problem (Brownlee, 2020). A lower learning rate will require more iterations as there are smaller changes after each iteration. Larger learning rates will have the opposite effect and require fewer iterations.</p>
							<p>If the learning rate is too large, however, the model can converge too rapidly and reach a suboptimal solution. If it’s too small, the process may take a very long time (Brownlee, 2020).</p>
							<p>Thus, it is important that the learning rate must be carefully selected for optimal outcomes.</p>

							<h2>Task - Emerging Research in ANN</h2>
							<h3>Part 1</h3>
							<p>For this task, we were asked to read an article by Mach (2021) and pick an application of neural networks in one industry and not the impact it has had in said industry.</p>
							<p>For healthcare, AI plays an influential role. Because of the importance of healthcare to the public, it is vital that any use of ANN or other AI will produce highly accurate results.</p>
							<p>Currently, there are clinical applications for analysis of electronic health records, medical image processing as well as workflow optimisation. Another example of its use is in drug discovery where machine learning and neural networks are used to help find effective medicines faster (Shahid et al., 2019).</p>
							<p>There are many applications for neural networks in healthcare, but there are difficulties such as having a wealth of data – this can be sometimes difficult to interpret (Ferguson, n.d.). Additionally, because of the need for high accuracy mentioned earlier, lots of research needs to be undertaken (Naik et al., 2022). Currently, medical diagnostics using AI is a heavily researched area and is currently being developed. This would have many benefits to the healthcare industry, but patients will need protection in case of a defective diagnosis (Mishra et al., 2023).</p>
							<h3>Part 2</h3>
							<p>We were also tasked to review how AI impacts insurance.</p>
							<p>There are many benefits to AI as stated in the article, like better pricing, fairer outcomes, and greater protection against harm (Snapshot paper - ai and personal insurance, 2019). However, there are ethical implications. If the AI is trained using biased data, then it will show that bias in its outputs. For example, if the AI was trained on only data pertaining to a specific class of people such as men, then results may show bias towards that group (Contributors, 2023).</p>
							<p>Additionally, as a customer, there is a clear lack of transparency as to how a decision is reached, especially when AI algorithms can be complex. This can also extend to digital marketing, where AI has analysed search behaviour. This can potentially coerce customer into buying unnecessary insurance and can exclude vulnerable groups (Mullins et al., 2021).</p>

							<h2>Task - Collaborative Discussion Initial Post – Legal and Ethical Views on ANN Applications</h2>
							<p>The article produced by Hutson discusses AI (in particular GPT-3) in terms of language models – models that can generate text given a prompt (Hutson, 2021). People have been taking advantage of this, using the AI to produce news articles which are hard to distinguish from news stories created by humans. This AI is not just limited to writing, it can generate code in multiple programming languages, solve mathematical problems etc. (Hutson, 2021).</p>
							<p>The advantages of this are many. In business applications, for example, this type of AI can be utilised to generate product descriptions and create FAQ pages (Cuofano, 2023). Use of AI increase efficiency by streamlining tedious tasks meaning that employees can better allocate their resources (Nielsen, 2023).</p>
							<p>However, there is an issue with AI tools such as GPT-3. The model has learned from data generated by humans, meaning that it picks up the inherent ethical flaws that come with that data (Heaven, 2021). For example, GPT-3 has many biases. In particular, it is prejudiced when it comes to religion – “racism” is associated with Judaism and “terrorism” is associated with Islam (Zaarour, 2022).</p>
							<p>Thus, when using such AI tools, it is paramount that the human element remains to oversee and scrutinise the work AI produces. AI is not replacing humans but is there to assist in tasks and increase productivity and efficiency (Oluwaniyi, 2023).</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 9 - Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This was my first introduction to convolutional neural networks. I learnt a lot from this unit that influenced the final team presentation in Unit 11. It was in this unit that I first used the Tensorflow library in python and learnt about convolutional layers, max pooling, filters and much more.</p>
							<p>In total, it was a lot of information to process, but was necessary to be able to better understand the capabilities of neural networks when it comes to image recognition.</p>
							<h2>Task - Wall Article</h2>
							<p>The article by Wall (2019) focuses on facial recognition performed by AI and it’s real world uses and implications.</p>
							<p>Particularly, police forces are using automated face recognition toe identify criminals and terrorists (Wall, 2019). Whilst this sounds good in theory, can we trust the AI to be good enough for use in high stakes situations?</p>
							<p>In my opinion, such technology should never be put to practice due to inherent biases in data, especially when it comes to policing; there have been many studies that identify algorithms that are used by the police are racist. For example, in the US, you are twice as likely to be arrested if you are black than if you are white (Heaven, 2023). If this is the type of data that AI is trained upon, then it is likely to show an equivalent bias in it’s results. Further, a report has shown that police are using falsified data to train AI (Hao, 2020).</p>
							<p>This shows that the logic used is faulty, if more black people are arrested, then black people are more likely to be identified as criminals by AI. If more police are dispatched to a neighbourhood, there will be more crime or arrests in that area (Reese, 2022).</p>
							<p>Until institutions such as the police are fundamentally changed to remove their bias, then AI use in this area should be limited.</p>

							<h2>Task – CNN Model</h2>
							<p>This was my first introduction to how a CNN model works in practice using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This proved useful going forward with the final group presentation as it used the same dataset.</p>
							<p>In this task we were asked to examine the CNN model provided to us in a Jupyter Notebook provided in the seminar materials.</p>
							<p>It can be observed that the model used two convolutional layers using the ReLU activation and a relatively low number of filters at 32. These were followed by a pooling layer. In architecture such as VGG, there are multiple convolutional layers that increase the number of filters each layer (Boesch, 2023).</p>
							<p>From the initial model, we can see there a total of 255,610 parameters. We can see that the validation accuracy is 67% in the final epoch before the early stopping occurs due to the validation loss not decreasing after 2 epochs (as the patience was set to 2).</p>
							<p>It is clear that this model could be improved upon with more convolutional layers as well as using regularisation techniques to improve accuracy and any underfitting or overfitting of the model (Brownlee, 2020).</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>The summary post for the second collaborative discussion was produced in this unit. This enhanced and enriched my views on the ethical implications of the use of neural networks as well as the potential legal implications.</p>
							<p>In the interactive task, I gained further knowledge and immersed myself in the world of CNNs. This proved useful for the presentation in Unit 11.</p>
							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion Summary Post – Legal and Ethical Views on ANN Applications</h2>
							<p>Evidently, the use of AI tools in business application is increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of employees as they can focus on other tasks that can be adequately completed by AI (Nielsen , 2023). This does not mean that humans are not necessary in the generative AI process, however (Tewari, 2023).</p>
							<p>Additionally, there are negative aspects to consider when it comes to use of AI tools. For example, there are ethical issues around the data used to generate text. If there are biases and prejudice in the data the AI learned from, then that may be reproduced when prompted (Zaarour, 2022).. In conjunction, there are legal concerns around intellectual property (copyright) when it comes to the training data of AI tools such as GPT-3. With no accountability, there are questions about the ethical use and authorship of work produced using AI (Hern, 2023).</p>
							<p>There are also overwhelming positives such as diminishing human error, especially when AI is used to automate repetitive tasks. It can be the first point of the customer experience when it comes to FAQs and help by utilisation of chatbots (Staff, 2023).</p>
							<p>In summary, the use of AI, particularly in business applications, is not going away and will increasing exponentially as tools get more powerful. There are associated advantages and risks, but as long as there is human intervention available, the risks will be mitigated (Reynolds, 2023).</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This was a vital unit to help me further understand the importance of model evaluation using R2 scores and ROC curves. With this information, it is easier to determine the prediction accuracy and the overall fit of the model, whilst looking out for factors such as underfitting and overfitting.</p>
							<p>Additionally, the group presentation was due in this unit. Again, I struggled with the task as I was largely left on my own to do the project as the other team members were either busy or unable to contribute for other reasons.</p>
							<p>I, however, embraced the challenge, and managed to produce an adequate CNN model after creating a baseline ANN model to predict images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This utilised all my knowledge gathered so far throughout the module and pushed me to learn more about tuning CNN models for better accuracy.</p>

							<h2>Task – Model Performance Measurement</h2>
							<p>In this task, I observed the changes of parameters affecting the AUC and R2 error. The Jupyter Notebook was provided in the seminar materials.</p>
							<p>The AUC (area under the curve or ROC curve) measures the are underneath an ROC curve. The ROC is a probability curve, and the AUC measures the degree of separability (Bhandari, 2023). Essentially, it measures how capable the model is at distinguish between different classes (Narkhede, 2021). The higher the AUC, the better the predictive model is.</p>
							<p>In the notebook, changing the number of features has varying impact on the AUC, and thus the predictive capabilities of the model in terms of accuracy.</p>
							<p>The R2 score is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. It can also be defined as the total variance explained by the model divided by the total variance (Kumar, 2023). High values indicate that there is perfect correlation between variables and low values indicate low correlation.</p>
							<p>A high R2 score generally indicates that the model is a good fit, although other considerations such as overfitting and underfitting should be taken into account.</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>As this was the last unit, I found it appropriate to summarise the learnings from the entire module.</p>
							<p>This module introduced me to neural networks (both ANN and CNN) and put a large emphasis on the ethical and legal nature of them. It was interesting to research and discuss the possible ethical dilemmas when it comes to neural networks and AI, especially when it comes to law enforcement. It helped emphasise the importance of understanding the underlying data of the model and identify potential bias and prejudice since this will have a huge impact on the outcome of the model.</p>
							<p>I can now confidently build a neural network from scratch with the knowledge I have gained from this module, as well as use crucial techniques in exploratory data analysis and other machine learning models such as regression.</p>
							<p>Particularly, the assessment in Unit 6 enabled me to find new machine learning models such as XGBoost that I didn’t previously have knowledge of. This ended up producing some of the best results in terms of accuracy for that project.</p>
							<p>Other things I will take away from this module is the importance of tuning models and being aware of overfitting and underfitting and how to avoid them.</p>
							<p>Overall, this was an enjoyable and interesting module to undertake, and I have come away more knowledgeable and confident in my abilities in machine learning.</p>
