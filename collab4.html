							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This was my second introduction to Machine Learning (as it had been used briefly in another module – Visualising Data).</p>
							<p>I learnt that there are many applications of machine learning in both medical practice and research as well as general business applications. This ranges from using clustering (partitioning data into groups) for customer segmentation to regression models to predict outcomes. Additionally, I learnt about the use of AI and neural networks and some of the risks in terms of legality and ethics. </p>
							<p>On top of this, I started the collaborative discussion regarding the 4th Industrial Revolution which focused on the impact of the failing of an information system.</p>
							<p>After completing this unit, I had a more informed understanding of machine learning in different industries.</p>

							<h2>Task – Collaborative Discussion Initial Post – The 4th Industrial Revolution</h2>
							<p>In September 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic in the UK, there was an IT failure that meant that nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases were unreported (Kelion, 2020). This was due to Public Health England using an old file format, xls, that could only handle 65,000 rows of data, rather than more modern formats like xlsx than can handle up to 1,000,000 (Vincent, 2020).</p>
							<p>Since this missing data would have been used for the NHS app to alert people that they may have been exposed to the virus, the impact of this meant that thousands of people may have been unaware of this exposure. Subsequently, this could have resulted in increased spread of the virus and further deaths.</p>
							<p>This demonstrates the importance of adapting and adopting new technologies in order to best deliver products and services (Schwab, 2016). There is a real need to replace these outdated systems for something more robust (Sevre et al., 2011). This is especially true when data is critical to public health (Birkhead, 2015).</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>This was another topic that I have had experience within a previous module, so naturally the concepts of this felt comfortable for me to learn and grasp.</p>
							<p>This allowed me to refresh my knowledge with EDA. EDA is a process to ensure that the data is understood and can be checked for null values, anomalies, and errors. It allows for appropriate feature selection to then be used in machine learning and can help test hypotheses (Patil, 2018).</p>
							<p>This topic was particularly useful for the first assignment as this was a large part in ensuring an accurate model was possible for the Airbnb dataset. I replaced null values and normalised the data and produced charts to analyse the data to see if there were any patterns.</p>

							</p>
							<h2>Task - EDA</h2>
							<p>Please find the Jupyter Notebook used for this task to see code and charts referred in the below text: <li><a href="https://github.com/rhowjo/rhowjo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Unit%202%20-%20EDA%20task.ipynb">EDA Jupyter Notebook.</a> </li></p>
							<p>In this task, I utilised several libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to assist in undertaking exploratory data analysis on the auto.mpg dataset downloaded from Kaggle.</p>
							<p>Initially, I looked at the head and tail of the data to get a brief understanding of the different columns and their values (Mahadevan, 2023). I also looked at the overall shape of the dataset to give a definitive answer to how many columns and rows there are (in this case 398 rows and 9 columns).</p>
							<p>An important step in EDA is to check for any errors or anomalies in the data (Chelliah, 2021). One step to check this is to look for null values. Looking at isnull().any() for the dataset, there appear to be no null values. However, when looking at the data types, horsepower is seen as type object. When looking at the values for horsepower, we can see that these are clearly numerical and should be an integer or float.</p>
							<p>Instead of a null value, there is a ‘?’. So, the next step was to change this to a null value, change it to float type and then replace the null value with the median value for the column. There are now no null values in the dataset and all data types are correct.</p>
							<p>Next, the scipy library is imported to look at the skew and kurtosis of the dataset.</p>
							<p>Skewness for columns such as ‘horsepower ‘is greater than 1 meaning that the data is highly skewed (Dan, 2020). Other columns are slightly skewed with some being fairly symmetrical. This level of skewness is generally acceptable.</p>
							<p>The kurtosis measure if the distribution is too peaked. Positive values mean that the distribution peaked more than normal, and a negative kurtosis indicates a flatter shape. Values closer to 0 indicate a dataset that is close to normal distribution. Generally, kurtosis values of +2 and above or -2 and above indicate that either the datasets distribution is too peaked or too flat (Hair et al, 2022). However, in the auto.mpg dataset, this is not the case as values fall within -1.5 to 0.8.</p>
							<p>In the final parts of the EDA, I looked at the correlation between variables. We can see that there are some instances of high correlation, the highest being between weight and displacement with a value of 0.8.</p>
							<p>I decided to explore this correlation further by plotting a scatter graph of the two variables and we can see that although there are outliers, the two variables are correlated.</p>
							<p>There is certainly more that can be done and achieved in an EDA, but this served as a good refresher and served as a good baseline for the EDA performed in the assessment in Unit 6.</p>

							<p>For this unit, I went through the process of data cleaning which is the quantitatively checking to ensure the data contains information that is accurate. (Huxley et al., 2020).This process follows gathering the raw data.  This helps ensure that the data is from inaccuracies and duplicates and removes or modifies incomplete, incorrectly formatted or corrupted data (Fitzgerald, 2022).</p>

This includes regulations (such as GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), 2016)) and standards (such as ISO27002). These essentially form a basis that organisation should follow for compliance (and by being compliant, increase chances to be more secure) (Kwon & Johnson, 2011).</p>

It consists of three or more backup cycles (daily, weekly, and monthly) allowing for independent retention policies for all (K, 2017).</p>
							<p>There are three tiers of backup within this strategy: the grandfather which is a full machine backup (usually offsite), the father which is another full backup to a local device, and the son is a regular incremental backup (Northcott, 2021).</p>
