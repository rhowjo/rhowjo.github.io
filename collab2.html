							<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Throughout the Deciphering Big Data module there was a common theme of having an overwhelming load of information as well as the pressure of the group projects looming. The module focused on the concept of big data (the four v’s (De Mauro et al., 2015), sourcing data, cleaning data, understanding various data types and data structures, understanding databases, database management systems, APIs, and the legal and compliance requirements of data.</p>
								<p>The following reflection will go briefly through my experience with the units within the module, with a stronger focus on my contributions to the two group projects in Unit 6 and in Unit 11 with consideration given to feedback and evaluating the initial proposal against the final project.</p>
							<h2>Units 1-12</h2>
								<p>Units 1 – 12 (which have more detailed learnings in my e-portfolio) were a challenging gauntlet of information, but I felt was paced well. The units flowed well into one another meaning that after finishing one unit, the information was more easily retained because it felt that it was merely a continuation of what I had already learned.</p>
								<p>I was unfortunately unable to join any of the seminars due to schedules clashing with work which meant that I had to employ more self-learning and motivate myself to go through the lectures and seminars. This helped improve my self-regulated learning which I have employed throughout this course (Schunk & Zimmerman, 2012).</p>
								<p>I also had to relearn my Python skills for the data cleaning tasks as I had not had the opportunity to use these since the first module of this course. This was stressful, but to deal with this, I used mediation techniques to help cope as many other students do (Aina & Hermilia Wijayati, 2019).</p>
							<h2>Initial Proposal (Group Project I)</h2>
								<p>For the initial proposal, my team had already begun work before I joined the team. This meant that some of the database model had been decided as they had done a surprising amount of work in so few days. I was disappointed by this because I felt this would lessen my overall contribution and I certainly felt more limited in what I could provide to the team.</p>
								<p>However, I made sure to do my best to scrutinise the tables and the choices made thus far for the model. In doing so, I could ask questions and improve the overall quality of the proposal by ensuring that the decisions made were the correct ones and if they were not, then they could be amended. Additionally, this gave me opportunity to truncate and restructure the document so that it read like a proposal and was within the word limit.</p>
								<p>These contributions are hard to quantify and evidence but were vital in the production of the final document.</p>
								<p>After receiving the feedback on this proposal, we went in the wrong direction and this will be discussed in the Final Project below.</p>
							<h2>Final Project (Group Project II) and Evaluation</h2>
								<p>Having received a grade lower than my personal expectations for the initial proposal in Unit 6, my team took the feedback on board and made one of our main focuses to rectify and improve upon the feedback. This is a common response from receiving such appraisal which can promote learning and change future behaviour (Baumeister et al., 2007). I did initially take this feedback negatively, but after discussing with my team, we were motivated to make the changes necessary for this project (Dembo & Seli, 2016).</p>
								<p>Thus, one of the actions was to increase our criticality of the choices made for our database. This meant evaluating why we had chosen to use for example, GCP, and why it best suited the clients needs. The possible advantages and disadvantages of the model were considered and carefully explained in the document.</p>
								<p>I made several contributions to the project other than the general discussions like the above that took place in team meetings and feedback through comments on the work in progress document. One of my main contributions was evaluating the legal and regulatory compliance required for the database model. Because there were tables containing PII (personal identifiable information) it was vital that we comply with GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), 2016) as an infringement can result in heavy fines and litigation (What if my company/organisation fails to comply with the Data Protection Rules? and Kwon & Johnson, 2011). I detailed the potential issues and how to comply. This also tied into security as well, as compliance can help reach a more secure database (McQuillan, 2022). Going forward, I will bear this information in mind when encountering PII and anything that falls under GDPR.</p>
								<p>Additionally, I was responsible for the structure, flow, and quality assurance of the document. Originally, we distributed sections to write amongst ourselves and then added them together. This did not flow well and very much looked like three different people wrote it. I took it upon myself to ensure that the document read as if one person had written it which I achieved. I also suggested adding the appendices instead of including them in the main body of work as this would improve the readability of the project. I cut and changed other members of the teams work whilst preserving the original meaning which also improved the readability. Finally, I contributed some of the advantages and disadvantages of the model.</p>
								<p>These contributions were integral to the success of the project, without their inclusion the document would not make sense and would be missing vital information on compliance. In comparison to the initial proposal, there were vast improvements, and I would be surprised to receive a grade as low.</p>
							<h2>Learnings</h2>
								<p>I have learned and developed many skills throughout this module. Working as a team of relative strangers has helped in my work life as I regularly deal with stakeholders that I do not know. In conjunction with this, I have developed self-learning techniques, and have improved on taking negative feedback by being less reactionary (negatively) and more initiative-taking and motivated to improve the next project.</p>
