							<h1 class="major">Unit 1 - Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>In this unit, I learned what the general idea behind big data is.</p>
							<p>Big data is defined by De Mauro et al., 2015 as:</p>
							<p><i>“Big Data represents the Information assets characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value”.</i></p>
							<p>This mentioned 3 of the 4 Vs of Big Data: volume, variety (refers to the number of different data types), and velocity (how efficiently data is transmitted).</p>
							<p>Veracity is the fourth V and refers to the data quality and availability (The four V's of big data, 2023).</p>
							<p>Understanding what big data is is vital to businesses as it denotes a situation where data sets have grown to the extent that conventional technologies can no longer handle the enormity of the data as well as its scalability and continued growth. This makes the data difficult to manage effectively with little chance of extracting value. It is important then to know how to handle big data in terms of its acquisition, storage, and analytics of the data (Ohlhorst, 2012).</p>
							<p>Overall, this unit helped me to understand the challenges and depth of concepts of big data.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>This unit provided me an overview of the various data types such as (but not limited to): characters, strings, lists, float, integer, dictionaries, Boolean, and variables. </p>
							<p>Additionally, this unit covered the different data formats: structured data (clearly defined , semi-structured data (textual data files with an apparent pattern such as emails and XML files), quasi-structured data (textual data with erratic formats that can be reformatted via software tools), and unstructured data (information that does not have a basic text format such as video and audio files) – Wietzal, 2022 and Structured vs unstructured data vs semi-structured data, 2022.</p>

							<p>Here is a snippet of Python code that was used for the web scraping task: <li><a href="https://www.valamis.com/hub/skills-matrix">Here.</a> </li></p>
							<p>Additionally, I learnt about the multitude of sources where data can be collected from like NGOs, education, and governments. As well as this, it is necessary to fact check and verify the sources to ensure that the data is valid (Kazil & Jarmul, 2016).</p>

							<h1 class="major">Unit 4 - Data Cleaning and Transformation</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>For this unit, I went through the process of data cleaning which is the quantitatively checking to ensure the data contains information that is accurate. (Huxley et al., 2020).This process follows gathering the raw data.  This helps ensure that the data is from inaccuracies and duplicates and removes or modifies incomplete, incorrectly formatted or corrupted data (Fitzgerald, 2022).</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>This continued from Unit 4 data cleaning and looked at utilising python and automation methods for the cleaning process. One such way of cleaning is replacing headers with more user friendly and then header matching to ensure that all columns have been captured.</p>
							<p>Additionally, in the exercise I changed formats, removed spaces, and removing null or na values.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>I learnt about database design in terms of normalisation which is an extension of data cleaning. However, in this case it means looking at statistics such as standard deviation to check for patterns and outliers, as well as checking the range.</p>
							<p>Additionally, primary keys (unique identifiers) are columns for a unique record within a table like an order number (Database key terms, explained and (What is primary and foreign keys in database (purpose and use), 2023)</p>
							<p>The first team project was submitted during this unit.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>This unit formed part of my biggest contribution to the final group project. It covered the compliance and regulatory frameworks for managing data. This includes regulations (such as GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), 2016)) and standards (such as ISO27002). These essentially form a basis that organisation should follow for compliance (and by being compliant, increase chances to be more secure) (Kwon & Johnson, 2011).</p>

							<p>Data science, like many industries in the past, is facing a potential shift (Ghuloom, 2022). Due to the power of automated machine learning (ML) tools becoming more applicable, the future of the data scientist is in doubt as fewer data scientists will be required (Saxena, 2021). Not only may there be fewer jobs, but the expectancy is also that a data scientist requires in depth knowledge encompassing a broad range of topics and skills (Yildirim, 2020).</p>
							<p>However, the role of the data scientist is unlikely to become obsolete. It is more likely that there will be a shift in responsibilities (Bösch, 2022; Wong, 2022; Selvaraj, 2022). There will still be requirements for data scientists to be able to interpret and understand the methods behind automation. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2021), human confidence is higher when there is a human element involved in the machine learning process despite automation having higher quality models and fewer errors.</p>
							<p>There is argument that with automation, there is less need for the responsibilities described by Yildirim (2020) (Wong, 2022). To an extent, there is scope for this to be true. However, as aforementioned, there remains need for understanding to be able to justify the use of automated ML for businesses. Thus, for better understanding, a bigger emphasis of MDM and data governance is critical for driving decisions on how ML is utilised. A data scientist needs to be at the core of managing this to have a significant impact (What is Master Data Management (MDM)? | Informatica UK, n.d.).</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the ‘social good’ aspect where data scientists who understand ML and automated ML can help causes that impact society. An example provided by Spanache, 2020 saw that the Center for Data Science and Public Policy helped identify when to carry out interventions for patients at risk. For causes that have such an impact, whether in combination with automation or not, a human understanding is needed.</p>
