							<p>Data science, like many industries in the past, is facing a potential shift (Ghuloom, 2022). Due to the power of automated machine learning (ML) tools becoming more applicable, the future of the data scientist is in doubt as fewer data scientists will be required (Saxena, 2021). Not only may there be fewer jobs, but the expectancy is also that a data scientist requires in depth knowledge encompassing a broad range of topics and skills (Yildirim, 2020).</p>
							<p>However, the role of the data scientist is unlikely to become obsolete. It is more likely that there will be a shift in responsibilities (Bösch, 2022; Wong, 2022; Selvaraj, 2022). There will still be requirements for data scientists to be able to interpret and understand the methods behind automation. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2021), human confidence is higher when there is a human element involved in the machine learning process despite automation having higher quality models and fewer errors.</p>
							<p>There is argument that with automation, there is less need for the responsibilities described by Yildirim (2020) (Wong, 2022). To an extent, there is scope for this to be true. However, as aforementioned, there remains need for understanding to be able to justify the use of automated ML for businesses. Thus, for better understanding, a bigger emphasis of MDM and data governance is critical for driving decisions on how ML is utilised. A data scientist needs to be at the core of managing this to have a significant impact (What is Master Data Management (MDM)? | Informatica UK, n.d.).</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the ‘social good’ aspect where data scientists who understand ML and automated ML can help causes that impact society. An example provided by Spanache, 2020 saw that the Center for Data Science and Public Policy helped identify when to carry out interventions for patients at risk. For causes that have such an impact, whether in combination with automation or not, a human understanding is needed.</p>
