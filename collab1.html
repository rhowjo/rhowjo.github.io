							<p>In this unit, I learned what the general idea behind big data is.</p>
							<p>Big data is defined by De Mauro et al., 2015 as:</p>
							<p><i>“Big Data represents the Information assets characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value”.</i></p>
							<p>This mentioned 3 of the 4 Vs of Big Data: volume, variety (refers to the number of different data types), and velocity (how efficiently data is transmitted).</p>
							<p>Veracity is the fourth V and refers to the data quality and availability (The four V's of big data, 2023).</p>
							<p>Understanding what big data is is vital to businesses as it denotes a situation where data sets have grown to the extent that conventional technologies can no longer handle the enormity of the data as well as its scalability and continued growth. This makes the data difficult to manage effectively with little chance of extracting value. It is important then to know how to handle big data in terms of its acquisition, storage, and analytics of the data (Ohlhorst, 2012).</p>

							<p>Data science, like many industries in the past, is facing a potential shift (Ghuloom, 2022). Due to the power of automated machine learning (ML) tools becoming more applicable, the future of the data scientist is in doubt as fewer data scientists will be required (Saxena, 2021). Not only may there be fewer jobs, but the expectancy is also that a data scientist requires in depth knowledge encompassing a broad range of topics and skills (Yildirim, 2020).</p>
							<p>However, the role of the data scientist is unlikely to become obsolete. It is more likely that there will be a shift in responsibilities (Bösch, 2022; Wong, 2022; Selvaraj, 2022). There will still be requirements for data scientists to be able to interpret and understand the methods behind automation. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2021), human confidence is higher when there is a human element involved in the machine learning process despite automation having higher quality models and fewer errors.</p>
							<p>There is argument that with automation, there is less need for the responsibilities described by Yildirim (2020) (Wong, 2022). To an extent, there is scope for this to be true. However, as aforementioned, there remains need for understanding to be able to justify the use of automated ML for businesses. Thus, for better understanding, a bigger emphasis of MDM and data governance is critical for driving decisions on how ML is utilised. A data scientist needs to be at the core of managing this to have a significant impact (What is Master Data Management (MDM)? | Informatica UK, n.d.).</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the ‘social good’ aspect where data scientists who understand ML and automated ML can help causes that impact society. An example provided by Spanache, 2020 saw that the Center for Data Science and Public Policy helped identify when to carry out interventions for patients at risk. For causes that have such an impact, whether in combination with automation or not, a human understanding is needed.</p>

							<p>Data science, like many industries in the past, is facing a potential shift (Ghuloom, 2022). Due to the power of automated machine learning (ML) tools becoming more applicable, the future of the data scientist is in doubt as fewer data scientists will be required (Saxena, 2021). Not only may there be fewer jobs, but the expectancy is also that a data scientist requires in depth knowledge encompassing a broad range of topics and skills (Yildirim, 2020).</p>
							<p>However, the role of the data scientist is unlikely to become obsolete. It is more likely that there will be a shift in responsibilities (Bösch, 2022; Wong, 2022; Selvaraj, 2022). There will still be requirements for data scientists to be able to interpret and understand the methods behind automation. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2021), human confidence is higher when there is a human element involved in the machine learning process despite automation having higher quality models and fewer errors.</p>
							<p>There is argument that with automation, there is less need for the responsibilities described by Yildirim (2020) (Wong, 2022). To an extent, there is scope for this to be true. However, as aforementioned, there remains need for understanding to be able to justify the use of automated ML for businesses. Thus, for better understanding, a bigger emphasis of MDM and data governance is critical for driving decisions on how ML is utilised. A data scientist needs to be at the core of managing this to have a significant impact (What is Master Data Management (MDM)? | Informatica UK, n.d.).</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the ‘social good’ aspect where data scientists who understand ML and automated ML can help causes that impact society. An example provided by Spanache, 2020 saw that the Center for Data Science and Public Policy helped identify when to carry out interventions for patients at risk.

							<p>Data science, like many industries in the past, is facing a potential shift (Ghuloom, 2022). Due to the power of automated machine learning (ML) tools becoming more applicable, the future of the data scientist is in doubt as fewer data scientists will be required (Saxena, 2021). Not only may there be fewer jobs, but the expectancy is also that a data scientist requires in depth knowledge encompassing a broad range of topics and skills (Yildirim, 2020).</p>
							<p>However, the role of the data scientist is unlikely to become obsolete. It is more likely that there will be a shift in responsibilities (Bösch, 2022; Wong, 2022; Selvaraj, 2022). There will still be requirements for data scientists to be able to interpret and understand the methods behind automation. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2021), human confidence is higher when there is a human element involved in the machine learning process despite automation having higher quality models and fewer errors.</p>
							<p>There is argument that with automation, there is less need for the responsibilities described by Yildirim (2020) (Wong, 2022). To an extent, there is scope for this to be true. However, as aforementioned, there remains need for understanding to be able to justify the use of automated ML for businesses. Thus, for better understanding, a bigger emphasis of MDM and data governance is critical for driving decisions on how ML is utilised. A data scientist needs to be at the core of managing this to have a significant impact (What is Master Data Management (MDM)? | Informatica UK, n.d.).</p>
							<p>Lastly, there is the ‘social good’ aspect where data scientists who understand ML and automated ML can help causes that impact society. An example provided by Spanache, 2020 saw that the Center for Data Science and Public Policy helped identify when to carry out interventions for patients at risk. For causes that have such an impact, whether in combination with automation or not, a human understanding is needed.</p>
